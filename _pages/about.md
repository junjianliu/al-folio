Hi! I am a Ph.D. student in the Edge lab at University of Southern California. My research interests focus on statistical analysis of trait differentiation and heritability in admixed populations. Currently I am working on comparisons of genetic and phenotypic differentiation. In the future, I aim to study human trait adaptation and explore the possibility of precision population health. I'm excited to connect with geneticists, evolutionary biologists, and anthropologists to exchange insights!
