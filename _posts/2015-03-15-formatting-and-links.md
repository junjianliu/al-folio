Comparisons of genetic and phenotypic differentiation are important for understanding the action of selection in evolutionary process. Researchers have used QST-FST approaches to compare the amount of trait differentiation among populations on one or more traits (measured by the statistic QST) with differentiation on genome-wide genetic variants (measured by FST). Under neutrality, FST and QST should be approximately equal in expectation, so QST much larger than FST is consistent with local adaptation, and QST much smaller than FST is consistent with stabilizing selection. Investigators have differed in their definitions of genome-wide FST (particularly regarding “ratio of averages” vs. “average of ratios” versions of FST) and in their definitions of the variance components in QST. Comparing incompatible estimators could produce inflated false positive rate as high as 20% when the nominal threshold is 5%. Further, the right choice of comparison distribution depends on genetic architecture. On this topic, I ran coalescent simulations to provide a guide to making QST-FST comparisons that are theoretically coherent and empirically conservative.
