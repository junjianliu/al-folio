  title={PREDICTM: A Pipeline for Robust Ensemble Deconvolution Using Integrated Cell-Type Markers from Multiple References },

  abstract={In this study, we present a robust marker selection procedure that aggregates ranked lists of top markers identified from multiple cross-platform reference datasets and normalizes the gene expression profile of each cell type with estimated cell-type mRNA abundances. The generated list of robust cell-type specific mRNA markers for major leukocyte cell types, including neutrophils, along with the pipeline is a useful tool to untangle large bulk transcriptome data for in-depth knowledge of immune cell subpopulations.},

  abstract={Potential adverse effect of drugs commonly prescribed to nursing home (NH) residents that outweigh benefits can be at least partially explained and reduced by pharmacogenetics (PGx), the study of the relationship between a person’s genetics and their responses toward medications. We assessed the feasibility of PGx testing among NH residents and evaluated the PGx testing benefit in a single NH population.},

  title={Uniparental Genetic Analyses Reveal the Major Origin of Fujian Tanka from Ancient Indigenous Daic Populations},
  author={Luo, X. Q., Du, P. X., Wang, L. X., Zhou, B. Y., Li, Y. C., Zheng, H. X., Wei, L. H., Liu, J. J., Sun, C., Meng, H. L., Tan, J. Z., Su, W. J., Wen, S. Q., & Li, H.},
  abstract={The Fujian Tanka people are officially classified as a southern Han ethnic group, whereas they have customs similar to Daic and Austronesian people. The origin of this group is controversial between three hypotheses: the Han Chinese origin, the ancient Daic origin, and the admixture between Daic and Han. This study revealed the admixed lineage affinity of the Tanka by analyzing the paternal Y chromosome and maternal mtDNA variation of Tanka and neighboring populations, as well as network and haplotype-sharing analyses, that the Tanka is closer to Daic in paternal lineages and to southern Han in maternal lineages such as Hakka and Chaoshanese.},
